Advanced Boot - full featured boot services on any device
By Ricky Divjakovski



Setting Advanced Boot preferences
    by default adv.boot.user.configurable is enabled
	adv.boot.user.configurable enabled will allow users to edit preferences from /sdcard/AdvBoot/boot.prefs.
	if not preferences from /system/boot.prefs will not be applied.
	if no preferences file there the tool will copy default preferences to /system/
	if no preferences file in /sdcard the /system copy will be copied to /sdcard if user configuration is enabled
	developers - edit the /system/boot.prefs file
	users - edit the /sdcard/boot.prefs file
	AdvBoot/boot.prefs will be loaded by default.
	if found /system/boot.prefs those settings will over-ride default settings.
	if found /sdcard/boot.prefs and adv.boot.user.configurable enabled those settings will over-ride default and system settings.
	you can see why a toggle is added to allow users to configure the preferences right? 
note:	if enabled default boot.prefs will be copied on first boot to /sdcard/boot.prefs is not found
		to enable user configuration.
		if users delete /sdcard/boot.prefs then user configurable will be disabled until they factory reset the device.

-Init.d
	enabling init.d will allow scripts to be executed on boot from the directory of choice(adv.boot.initd.path).


-External init.d
	enabling will allow scripts to run from a secondary directory of choice(adv.boot.external.initd.path).
	this option is for developers who prefer their rom not be modified by users but enable them to have the same
